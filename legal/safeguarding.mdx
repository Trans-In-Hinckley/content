## 1. Our Commitment

Trans in Hinckley is committed to promoting the welfare of all people, especially children (under 18) and vulnerable adults, and expects all staff, volunteers, and users to share this commitment. This policy outlines the procedures we follow when we receive information suggesting that a user may be at risk of harm or is causing harm to others.

## 2. Scope and Definitions

### A. Scope

This policy applies to all communications and information submitted to Trans in Hinnckley, particularly through the dedicated Safeguarding Form, but also via the Contact Form or other direct communication channels.

### B. Key Definitions

* **Safeguarding:** Protecting children and vulnerable adults from harm, including abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and ensuring their well-being.
* **Vulnerable Adult:** Any person aged 18 or over whose ability to protect themselves from neglect or harm is significantly impaired.
* **Child:** Any person under the age of 18.
* **Harm/Abuse:** Includes physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, financial abuse, exploitation, and institutional abuse.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

### Safeguarding Lead

The designated person responsible for overseeing the implementation of this policy and handling all reported concerns is the Safeguarding Lead.

* **Safeguarding Lead:** Group Coordinator

* **Contact for Immediate Concern:** [safeguarding@transinhinckley.org.uk](mailto:safeguarding@transinhinckley.org.uk)

Responsibilities of the Lead:

1. To ensure all concerns are recorded accurately and confidentially.

2. To assess the severity of the reported concern.

3. To determine if external reporting to statutory agencies is legally required or necessary for the protection of life/safety.

4. To act as the liaison between Trans in Hinckley and external statutory agencies (e.g., Police, Social Services).

## 4. Reporting Procedures

If a concern is raised via the Safeguarding Form, the following procedure is initiated immediately:

### Step 1: Immediate Review and Assessment

The Safeguarding Lead will immediately review the information to assess the level of risk. If there is immediate danger to life or safety, the lead will skip to Step 4.

### Step 2: Confidential Recording
All details of the concern, the individual(s) involved (if known), and the time/date of the submission are recorded securely and confidentially. Access is restricted to the Safeguarding Lead only.

### Step 3: Determining Necessity for Action

The Lead will consult internal guidelines (where applicable) and local safeguarding thresholds to determine the necessity of sharing the information externally. Factors considered include:

* The age of the individual(s) at risk.

* The nature and severity of the alleged harm or neglect.

* The urgency of the situation.

### Step 4: External Reporting (Mandatory Sharing)

If the Safeguarding Lead determines that an individual is at risk of serious harm or exploitation, or if there is a legal duty to report, the Lead will report the concern to the relevant statutory authorities (e.g., Police, Children's Social Care, Adult Social Care) without delay.

* **Note:** In an emergency, our commitment is to contact emergency services (e.g., 999/911/112) first.

## 5. Confidentiality and Information Sharing

Confidentiality is a fundamental principle of our service; however, it is not absolute.

1. **Limits to Confidentiality:** Confidentiality must be broken when necessary to prevent serious harm to a person, especially if they are a child or vulnerable adult, or if we are legally required to disclose information.

2. **Information Sharing (as stated in the Privacy Policy):** When a mandatory report is made (Step 4), we will share only the minimum necessary personal and sensitive data with appropriate statutory services to ensure safety. This is processed under the legal basis of vital interests or substantial public interest (safeguarding).

## 6. Data Retention of Safeguarding Records

Due to the critical, legal, and ethical nature of safeguarding records, any data submitted via the Safeguarding Form or internal documentation related to a mandatory report will be retained for a period of **7 years** from the date the concern was closed, or longer if required by local legislation. This ensures compliance and provides an accurate record for any future legal inquiries.
